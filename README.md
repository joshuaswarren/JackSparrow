# JackSparrow

## Purpose

JackSparrow is a simple PHP library that uses the API at http://isithackday.com/arrpi.php to translate English to 'Pirate'. 

This library exists primarily to serve as a test-bed and example for creating a single PHP library that will work with a number of different PHP frameworks.
